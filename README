First of all, when I changed the Makefile to include the -O0 option, a segfault
started showing up.  This came up because a NULL pointer was not being added to
the end of a command.  To fix this lines 52-68 were changed in text_parsing.c.

The stat buffer had to be freed on line 64, 68, and 73 of proc_creation_prog_exe.c.

The line_copy variable also had to be freed on line 113 text_parsing.c.
